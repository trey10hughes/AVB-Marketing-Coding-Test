# AVB Marketing Coding Test - Contacts App
This is an application to edit view and edit contacts using a given API.

This app was created using Create-React-App, and uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

To start the app use the command "npm run start" at the root directory of the project.

## Features

### Contacts list
This allows the user to view all contacts available through the API. Upon selecting a contact from this list, the user will see more detailed information about that contact on the right side of the screen.

### Contact details
This is the portion of the screen in which the details about a selected contact will render. The user should be able to add or delete email addresses from a given contact.
